I've been using Twitter for almost 12 years now, and I still love talking to people, learning and making jokes there. It sometimes can be challenging to navigate your timeline, so today I'm sharing some tips to keep it fun.

## Who to Follow

The beauty of Twitter is that it's a unique experience for everyone - you can pick topics that interest you by choosing whom to follow. 

Be picky whose comments you want to read, who's thoughts you want to consume daily. I try to avoid folks that are too negative, or folks that try to impress with "inspirational quotes" or people whose signal/noise ratio is too high.

What do I mean with signal/noise ratio? I follow folks so I can learn more about certain topics. Some I know already, some we met at conferences, and some I'd love to meet eventually. Of course you also want to share bits of yourself in your timeline, but if you only talk about the weather, food or your kids, it's probably not a fit for me - and that's okay! Everyone can use Twitter as they prefer it, and it's impossible to follow everyone anyhow, so choose whatever content you prefer!

As I recently [learned](https://twitter.com/ndbroadbent/status/1317522304008556545?s=21), there's an upper limit of 5000 people you can follow on Twitter. I would suggest to really try to stay below 1000, everything else is not manageable. I'm currently at 1500 but also follow many accounts that have stopped tweeting over the years or are extremely low in volume.

I try to read most in my timeline but gave up being a completionist. Twitter needs time and commitment but shouldn't feel like work, and there's time it definitely is work to read though everything.

I know that some people can take it personal if you unfollow, but I've been past caring about that. You need to filter what you consume, so unfollow when you don't enjoy someone's content.

Don't worry about missing out - Twitter is a stream and you can never read everything.

## Mute Early, Mute Often

Muting accounts is *beautiful* - people can still see your content, but you just don't see their replies anymore. In the early days it took a lot to make me mute someone, now I think very different about this feature.

I mute pretty much any account I don't find interesting. This includes basically all brands, almost all accounts that send ads my way or anything related to sport events. **There is no limit on how many accounts you can mute.**

Muting is useful because it hides content that other folks retweet, without having to disable their retweets altogether. It's also great to simply hide folks you don't want to interact with. They can still see your content, you just won't read their (snarky) reply.

Mute early, mute often. It's your experience after all. If you miss a reply and someone really wants to reach you, they will find your email.

## Muting Keywords

You can **mute up to 100 keywords** or even partial sentences, tt doesn't need to be a hashtag. Here's a selection of the things I mute:

- #MyTwitterAnniversary (I really don't care about these)
- shooting (Protects my sanity)
- constitution, police, assault, shooting, killing, #VOTE (Probably something American that will just make me upset)
- #digital, #offer, #BusinessTransformation, #sponsored, #blockchain, #bigdata (If you use this as keyword, the content will be crap)
- NASCAR, Lakers, #F1, Strava, #CloseYourRings (not interested in sports or where you run or bike)
- #Covid_19 (I read news about the pandemic when I feel like it. I don't need that every 5 minutes)
- [food] (I already like food too much, don't tempt me Frodo!)

## Blocking

Blocking always felt weird. It's something I rarely do. It's more a *childish* act, since you can't hide content that is public - you're just making it less convenient for the person to read your tweets.

I very very rarely block. There's been a case where someone replies to a RT of mine with mean comments, and since that does show me as connection to hateful or insulting comments, I quickly blocked that person. If it's just a challenging reply, I  usually don't block - it's fun to be challenged! (And there's always mute if you stop enjoying it.)

## Disabling Retweets

Some people retweet a lot of content that I don't find particularly interesting, so I disable retweets on their account. I do this probably for 5-10% of the accounts I follow and I know some people who have that on for 100%.

This also implies changes in Twitter behavior: If you want to be sure someone sees content, use a quote tweet. But don't use that too often, as [it can be annoying it itself](https://twitter.com/NeoNacho/status/1313595333159469056).

Before disabling retweets completely, consider using Mute to just filter out content that's not interesting to you.

## On Using Hashtags

**Please don't use hashtags.** If I could write a filter that automatically blocks all tweets with more than one hashtag, I would absolutely use it.[^1]

Hashtags are usually used by people that don't know how Twitter work, or by companies that push ads that #use a #hashtag for #almost #every #word, and it's really unnecessary and annoying to read.

Don't be a noob, don't use hashtags. Exception are for fun hashtags or conferences. #butwhatdoiknow
