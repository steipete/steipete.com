A few weeks after kernel panics started showing up on my MacBook Pro (and after many comments were left, in which I kept pinging Apple and reporting on this issue, and after trying a Supplemental Update but still suffering from this bug), somebody recommended to me that I should disable the “[Power Nap](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204032)” feature. I was skeptical, but sure enough, ever since I disabled it, the kernel panics stopped. 

If you just started reading now, check out the backstory: [Kernel Panics and Surprise boot-args](https://steipete.com/posts/kernel-panic-surprise-boot-args/).

The problem seemingly fixed, I brushed it off and almost forgot about it, but two months after I reported my issue via Feedback Assistant, Apple replied!

I mean, it’s something. But it’s also somewhat of a joke. After my initial reaction of getting mad at how bad Apple’s communication is here, I started seeing this as a challenge and began my search to determine what they could have possibly meant with “Core Dump.”

## The Great Core Dump Mystery

If you google “macOS core dump” [you will eventually end up on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9412156/how-to-generate-core-dumps-in-mac-os-x/12118329 ), as is the case with so many things.

The article I found recommends setting `ulimit -c unlimited`, but this didn’t seem right — how is that related to a kernel panic? 

Next up, I looked into Apple’s [Technical Note TN2151: Understanding and Analyzing Application Crash Reports](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2124/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003391-CH1-SECCOREDUMPS), which has a section about Core Dumps, and it also mentioned `ulimit`:

>You can enable core dumps on a system-wide basis by adding the line limit core unlimited to your /etc/launchd.conf file

Problem: This file doesn’t even exist on macOS Catalina. But the above document was last updated in 2010, so that might explain why.

Via [Quinn “The Eskimo!”](https://twitter.com/justkwin/status/1260674056023572481), I also learned about [the use case for application core dumps to debug crashers](https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/401103#401103).

## Kernel Core Dump(lings)

I’ve asked around on Twitter and learned that [a *kernel* core dump is something else entirely](https://twitter.com/gparker/status/1260714803191885825). Thanks to [Sarah](https://twitter.com/winocm/status/1260815939001446406?s=21) for helping me here!

Welcome to two easy steps to create your kernel core dump!

1 — Change the boot-args to enable kernel debugging. This needs to be run with csrutil disabled or in recovery mode. `keepsyms=1` is used to symbolicate the panic log:

```
sudo nvram boot-args="debug=0x104c44 keepsyms=1"
```

2 — Once you get a panic with the debug= boot-args set, just dd the `Apple_KernelCoreDump` volume on your APFS container to a file:

```
dd if=“~/IntelFramebufferFun.img” of="/Volumes/Apple_KernelCoreDump" 
```

## Deciphering 0x104c44

Of course, my curiosity was sparked when reading `debug=0x104c44`, which led to just one search result for a [crash with VirtualBox](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=92617).

All the flags below are related to macOS kernel debugging. It’s easier to look at them one by one when we move to a binary representation. Thankfully, XNU is open source, so we can just look up the source code of [`/osfmk/kern/debug.h`](http://newosxbook.com/src.jl?tree=xnu&file=/osfmk/kern/debug.h).

`0x104c44 = 1 0000 0100 1100 0100 0100`

`DB_NMI 0x4` changes the power button to create a non-maskable interrupt? (These days, NMI is ⌃+⌘+⌥+⇧+power; the old behavior is via 0x8000.)

`DB_ARP 0x40` allows debugging across subnets via ARP (usual flag).
 
`DB_KERN_DUMP_ON_PANIC 0x400` Trigger core dump on panic.

`DB_KERN_DUMP_ON_NMI 0x800` Trigger core dump on NMI.

`DB_REBOOT_POST_CORE 0x4000` Attempt to reboot after post-panic crashdump/paniclog dump.

`DB_REBOOT_ALWAYS 0x100000` Don't wait for debugger connection.

Let’s check if we got everything: `0x100000 + 0x4000 + 0x800 + 0x400 + 0x40 + 0x4 = 0x104c44`.

## Conclusion

After writing up my story here, I found [an article on Mr. Macintosh](https://mrmacintosh.com/10-15-4-update-wake-from-sleep-kernel-panic-in-16-mbpro-2019/) that documents the very same wake-from-sleep kernel panic. It seems it is fixed in macOS 10.15.5 Beta 4, so there’s no need for me to actually send a macOS Core Dump anymore.

Still, it was an interesting learning experience.

Update: Apple followed up again on FB7642937, this time with detailed instructions: see [Network Kernel Core Dump](/posts/network-kernel-core-dump/) for more on this.
