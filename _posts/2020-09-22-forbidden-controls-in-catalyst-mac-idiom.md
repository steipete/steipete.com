While working on our [PDF Viewer](https://pdfviewer.io) update for Big Sur and switching to the new Catalyst Mac Interface Idiom, I was greeted with a new exception, coming directly from UIKit:

```
[General] UIStepper is not supported when running Catalyst apps in the Mac idiom.

```

## Catalyst Mac Idiom

Let’s take a step back — what’s the Catalyst Mac Idiom? With macOS 11 Big Sur, Catalyst learned a new presentation mode. Next to the classic mode where Catalyst apps are scaled to 77 percent and retain their iPad look, there’s a **new Optimize Interface for Mac mode** that doesn’t use scaling and replaces various UIKit controls with AppKit counterparts.

![Xcode Selector for Catalyst Idiom](/assets/img/2020/mac-idiom-forbidden-controls/mac-idiom-selector.png)

The new mode is available with Big Sur, and apps can be built so that they use scaling on Catalina and the new Mac mode on Big Sur. We’ll be releasing a new version of [PDF Viewer for Mac](https://pdfviewer.io) using the new optimized mode as soon as Apple finalizes Big Sur.

If you write code that works on both Catalina and Big Sur, a category like this will be useful:

```swift
extension UIDevice {
    /// Checks if we run in Mac Catalyst Optimized For Mac Idiom
    var isCatalystMacIdiom: Bool {
        if #available(iOS 14, *) {
            return UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom == .mac
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }
}
```

This can later be used, for example, in SwiftUI (SwiftUI’s `Stepper` maps to `UIStepper`, which is disallowed):

```swift
// UIStepper is not allowed for Catalyst Mac Idiom.
if !UIDevice.current.isCatalystMacIdiom {
    Stepper("Current Page: \(pageIndex + 1)", value: $pageIndex, in: 0...document.pageCount - 1)
    .padding()
}
```

## AppKit In UIKit

Internally, Apple uses a private `_UINSView` class to host an actual `NSView`. It’s too bad we didn’t get this class public, which would’ve allowed us to freely mix AppKit with UIKit, but it’s a start.

![UIButton Mac Idiom](/assets/img/2020/mac-idiom-forbidden-controls/uinsview.png)

If we look into the runtime, the class does pretty much what you’d expect (I omitted some less useful methods for the sake of brevity):

```
lldb) po [NSClassFromString(@"_UINSView") _shortMethodDescription]
<_UINSView: 0x7fff86fac238>:
in _UINSView:
	Properties:
		@property (readonly) struct CGSize _intrinsicFrameSize;
		@property (readonly) NSView* contentNSView;  (@synthesize contentNSView = _contentNSView;)
```

## Forbidden Controls

Back to our crash — things make a bit more sense now. There’s no great equivalent for `UIStepper` in AppKit, so the folks at Apple decided it’s better to throw an exception if this control is used (FB8727188).

The problem: It isn’t documented which controls are disallowed, and what’s even more problematic is some controls are allowed, but customizations are disallowed. What does `UISlider` map toward? We can get the pointer from the visual debugger and then use our knowledge of the class structure to call directly into the AppKit view:

```
(lldb) po [0x7f9503c488f0 contentNSView]
<NSSlider: 0x7f9503c37a40> 
```

`NSSlider` is the obvious choice, however, the Mac version lacks the appearance customization options UIKit has. Calling any of these customization methods will simply throw (crash) at runtime:

```
setMinimumTrackImage:forState: is not supported on PSPDFBrightnessSlider when running Catalyst apps in the Mac idiom.
 (
	0   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff2067fbdf __exceptionPreprocess + 242
	1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x00007fff2029f469 objc_exception_throw + 48
	2   UIKitCore                           0x00007fff464af1e5 -[UIView(UICatalystMacIdiomUnsupported_Internal) _throwForUnsupportedNonMacIdiomBehaviorWithReason:] + 0
	3   UIKitCore                           0x00007fff4582af70 -[UISlider setMinimumTrackImage:forState:] + 197
```

This is problematic, as it’s yet another restriction that isn’t documented. A better choice would’ve been to keep the UIKit variant in case customization exceeds what AppKit can do. It’s a surprising late change, and folks working on Catalyst apps are frustrated:

## Finding What’s Forbidden

Since there’s no documentation and there are no release notes about any of these behaviors, that just leaves Hopper and decompiling UIKitCore.

We find references to following controls:

- `UIStepper`
- `UIPickerView`
- `UIRefreshControl`
- `UISwitch` (inside `setTitle:`)
- `UIButton`

The main method throwing is `_throwForUnsupportedNonMacIdiomBehaviorWithReason`, so it makes sense to search for it. It checks if the bundle identifier starts with "com.apple", and in it does, it just logs an error, while all other apps get an exception. There’s yet another check for `_allowsUnsupportedMacIdiomBehavior`, which is interesting. It seems the above controls at least have partial support in Big Sur. This can be enabled via calling `_setAllowsUnsupportedMacIdiomBehavior:]` on them. And indeed, calling `[UIStepper _setAllowsUnsupportedMacIdiomBehavior:1];` (I’m using Objective-C here since it’s easier to just redeclare the method in the header) does result in a working app.

There’s a stepper (next to the “Current Page: 2” label), however, clicking it doesn’t work. This is obviously not something you should ever use for shipping, but it’s fun to play with the internals!

## Digging Deeper

However most of the throw calls seem to be missing. I’ve been looking at the iOS version this whole time, when clearly this is conditional code and we need to look at the macOS version instead.

iOS Path: `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/UIKitCore.framework`[^1]

macOS Path: `/System/iOSSupport/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/UIKitCore.framework`

However, when you open the framework on macOS, there’s no binary. WTH? I remembered reading that Big Sur ships with [a built-in dynamic linker cache of all system-provided libraries](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/06/26/reverse-engineering-macos-11-0/). Luckily, [Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com/) has already been updated to know about that shared cache, so you can load it via `/System/Library/dyld/` and then select `UIKitCore` as the target.

Wait until everything is loaded and then select File > Produce Pseudo-Code File for All Procedures. This might take a few hours. Once the file is generated, pick a *fast* text editor (my weapon of choice for something like this is Sublime Text) and load the file. There, search for `_throwForUnsupportedNonMacIdiomBehaviorWithReason:` again.

The problem: The file is heavily obfuscated; Hopper can’t read the selector names. We can search for the string "Unsupported iOS or Mac Catalyst iPad Idiom" to find the selector matching `_throwForUnsupportedNonMacIdiomBehaviorWithReason:`. In my case, that’s `sub_7fff465801e5`.

## Conclusion

However, that’s the end of the story for now. The data is there, but the tools can’t [yet (!)](https://twitter.com/bsr43/status/1308462962680659971?s=21) get a useful format out. We know that there are at least five controls that throw an exception on *some* usage at runtime, however, which one it is exactly is currently hard to know. Shipping a Catalyst app in the new Mac idiom is definitely an adventure.

## Decompile via LLDB

Jeff Johnson points out that one can [abuse LLDB to piecemeal decompile methods](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/bigsur3.html). That approach would take far too long to find all the calls that throw here, but it’s a start.

## Decompile via dyld-shared-cache-big-sur

The [dyld-shared-cache-big-sur project](https://github.com/antons/dyld-shared-cache-big-sur) uses modifications to Apple’s dyld project to fix Objective-C information when extracting the dyld_shared_cache from macOS Big Sur to help Hopper generate readable pseudocode. (Thanks [@lclhrst](https://twitter.com/lclhrst/status/1308468526840152064?s=21) for the hint!)

Using this project, we can extract the dyld cache into a folder:

```
./dyld_shared_cache_util -extract ~/Developer/macOS\ Big\ Sur /System/Library/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_x86_64
```

And then we can decompile UIKitCore with selector names. This doesn’t resolve the individual selector calls, but it’s a step forward.

[^1]: In the early days, it was just UIKit. A few years ago, Apple created an internal framework called UIKitCore, which exports more API and can be used for internal apps. UIKit is the smaller API for external developers (us).
