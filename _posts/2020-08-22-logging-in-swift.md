With iOS 14, Apple improved the built-in logging framework and added many missing pieces. Is OSLog now something that can finally be used?

## [Does OSLogStore Work Yet?](http://doesoslogstoreworkyet.com)

<p style="font-size: 300%;">No.*</p> 
*Apple removed `OSLogStore` surprisingly from iOS with the GM release. [Jump to the changes made in iOS 14 GM](#update-testing-with-ios-14-gm).

## Why OSLog Is Awesome

Every developer uses some form of logging, be it `NSLog` in Objective-C or `print` in Swift. These helpers are convenient, but they don’t scale — there’s no concept to classify messages.

Apple [introduced `os_log`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/os_log) with iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 in an attempt to provide a better universal logging system.[^7] It supersedes the ageing Apple System Logger (ASL) and comes with features expected from a modern logging system:

- **Categorization and Filtering** — Log levels and grouping via subsystem and category.
- **Privacy** — Dynamic strings, collections, and arrays are replaced to preserve personally identifiable information. This can be overridden on a per-parameter basis.
- **Usability** — The logging information collects calling information for you, and it’s integrated into the system via `Console.app` and the log command line tool. If activity tracing is used, logs are automatically correlated.
- **Performance** — Logs are stored extremely efficiently and all system logs are in one place.

You might have already stumbled over the log, as you now need a third breakpoint when investigating where a log message is coming from: Next to `NSLog` and `CFLog`, you now need a breakpoint to `_os_log_impl`.

[^7]: This post doesn’t address `os_signpost`, `os_trace`, and `os_activity` — all of which are amazing features that fit into the logging concept and that you should be using.

## The New Swift Logging Framework

Instead of calling `os_log`, you can now use the new [`Logger`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logger) struct in Swift — at least if you have the luxury of exclusively supporting iOS 14 already:

```swift
let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.steipete.LoggingTest", category: "main")
logger.info("Logging \(obj.description, privacy: .public)")
```

This innocent-looking code uses a bunch of new tricks! First off, the new [string interpolation feature of Swift 5](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E143-string-interpolation-in-swift-5) is used to make it easy to customize the privacy of data.

Second, Apple modified the Swift compiler to allow [compile-time constant expressions](https://gist.github.com/marcrasi/b0da27a45bb9925b3387b916e2797789) to evaluate the string at compile time. This ensures that logging is extremely fast. The technology behind it is fascinating, and it seems it was worth the wait.[^6] For more example code, see Apple’s excellent documentation on [Generating Log Messages from Your Code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging/generating_log_messages_from_your_code).

[^6]: Apple claimed in the [WWDC 2016 video about unified logging](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/721/) that support for Swift was coming “real soon.” It took four years, but Apple finally delivered on a worthy wrapper.

## Calling os_log in Swift

If you still need to use iOS 13 or are curious how things worked back in the day, here’s how calling `os_log` works. Naively, you might try following approach:

```swift
os_log("foo: \(x) \(obj.description)", log: OSLog.default, type: .debug)
```

The compiler complains right away:

> Cannot convert value of type 'String' to expected argument type 'StaticString'

`os_log` requires the use of Objective-C style format strings for performance and security reasons.[^4] At the same time, Apple also strongly recommends to avoid wrapping `os_log`. So there’s really no way around using the following syntax:

```swift
os_log("foo: %@ %@", log: .default, type: .debug, x, obj.description)
```

[^4]: It’s fairly easy to cause undefined behavior with NSLog when Swift string interpolation and Swift format specifiers are mixed. There’s a [great example of this on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53025803/83160). `os_log` also supports a few special identifiers that aren’t part of NSString, so it’s not exactly the same.

### What’s the Problem with Wrapping OSLog?

OSLog is designed to accept static strings, in order to be fast and to correctly separate between dynamic data (private) and static data (public). Most wrappers simply forward messages via `os_log("%{public}@"...`, which makes all strings dynamic and public, removing most of the benefits of OSLog.

Apple maintains a separate [`SwiftLog`](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) logging framework for the Swift on Server ecosystem.[^8] The framework supports plugins, and there’s a third-party [swift-log-oslog plugin](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/swift-log-oslog), which forwards logs to the `os_log` machinery. Apple does link to it but also explicitly [warns about usage](https://github.com/apple/swift-log#selecting-a-logging-backend-implementation-applications-only):

[^8]: There are efforts underway to try to unify or at least better align the two logging frameworks. See [Logging levels for Swift’s server-side logging APIs and new os_log APIs](https://forums.swift.org/t/logging-levels-for-swifts-server-side-logging-apis-and-new-os-log-apis/20365) in the Swift Forums.

>we recommend using os_log directly as decribed [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging). Using os_log through swift-log using this backend will be less efficient and will also prevent specifying the privacy of the message. The backend always uses `%{public}@` as the format string and eagerly converts all string interpolations to strings. This has two drawbacks: 1. the static components of the string interpolation would be eagerly copied by the unified logging system, which will result in loss of performance. 2. It makes all messages public, which changes the default privacy policy of os_log, and doesn’t allow specifying fine-grained privacy of sections of the message. In a separate on-going work, Swift APIs for os_log are being improved and made to align closely with swift-log APIs. References: [Unifying Logging Levels](https://forums.swift.org/t/custom-string-interpolation-and-compile-time-interpretation-applied-to-logging/18799), [Making os_log accept string interpolations using compile-time interpretation](https://forums.swift.org/t/logging-levels-for-swifts-server-side-logging-apis-and-new-os-log-apis/20365).

There are also surprising bugs like [doubles that aren’t logged correctly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50937765/why-does-wrapping-os-log-cause-doubles-to-not-be-logged-correctly), which can be very hard to debug.

## Accessing Log Files

Log files are useful whenever users report a bug or a crash is being sent. Most logging frameworks therefore include a rolling file logger, which makes it easy to access logs on demand.

Apple’s [solution](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/650843?answerId=616460022) to accessing logs is either collecting a `sysdiagnose` or calling `log collect --device` on a terminal. The latter possibly requires filtering the output via the `--start` or `--last` limits and then sending the output manually. 

This might work if your audience is macOS developers, but if you’re targeting regular users, it’s much harder to make them follow a tutorial and then explain how to send a multiple-hundred-megabyte `sysdiagnose`. Furthermore, this will only work if your user runs a recent version of macOS.

In all practicality, this resulted in basically no app using `os_log` directly, which completely defeats the point. The most used logging frameworks to date seem to be [SwiftyBeaver](https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver) and [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack).

The inability to access logs has been a point of personal frustration; there are [multiple](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/66984) forum entries where people are just baffled that this doesn’t exist. I’ve brought it up every year in the WWDC labs except for in 2020. The usual answer is “Apple cares about privacy, so accessing logs is a no-go,” but the alternative is that people use other logging frameworks that have no privacy-preserving features built in.

At [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/), we tried switching to `os_log` but hit the same issues: Our customers depend on [a custom log handler](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/features/logging/#custom-log-handler) that integrates our log messages with their infrastructure. To date, this can only be done with OSLog using SPI.[^2]

[^2]: System Programming Interface. This is a private API that’s used within Apple’s frameworks. As such, it’s extremely rare that SPI is changed, unlike completely internal private APIs.

## New in iOS 14: OSLogStore

With [`OSLogStore`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/oslog/oslogstore), Apple added an API to access the log archive programmatically. It allows accessing `OSLogEntryLog`, which contains all the log information you’ll possibly ever need. 

The new store access is available for all platform versions of 2020. It’s the missing piece in the `os_log` story that finally will get us the best of both worlds. Let’s look at how this works:

```swift
func getLogEntries() throws -> [OSLogEntryLog] {
    // Open the log store.
    let logStore = try OSLogStore(scope: .currentProcessIdentifier)
    
    // Get all the logs from the last hour.
    let oneHourAgo = logStore.position(date: Date().addingTimeInterval(-3600))
    
    // Fetch log objects.
    let allEntries = try logStore.getEntries(at: oneHourAgo)
    
    // Filter the log to be relevant for our specific subsystem
    // and remove other elements (signposts, etc).
    return allEntries
        .compactMap { $0 as? OSLogEntryLog }
        .filter { $0.subsystem == subsystem }
}
```

The code is fairly straightforward; however, the above version has various issues, e.g. it works on macOS but doesn’t work on iOS.

### Swift Overlay Issues

Apple forgot to add the Swift overlay shims on iOS, so we need to use some tricks to access the Objective-C enumerator ([FB8518476](https://openradar.appspot.com/FB8518476)):

```swift
#if os(macOS)
    let allEntries = try logStore.getEntries(at: oneHourAgo)
#else
    // FB8518476: The Swift shims for the entries enumerator are missing.
    let allEntries = try Array(logStore.__entriesEnumerator(position: oneHourAgo, predicate: nil))
#endif
```

Since the non-sugared version also works on macOS, it’s not necessary to do an if/else dance at all. However, this is a good pattern to document how it should work, assuming the bug gets fixed before the GM.

### Predicate Issues

The next issue is that the entries enumerator has a built-in way of filtering via the predicate. However, this doesn’t seem to work ([FB8518539](https://openradar.appspot.com/FB8518539)):

```swift
// TODO: How to format the predicate? See "PREDICATE-BASED FILTERING" in `man log`.
// Things I tried unsuccessfully:
// - NSPredicate(format: "subsystem == %@", "com.steipete.LoggingTest")
// - NSPredicate(format: "subsystem == \"com.steipete.LoggingTest\"")
```

Credit for the syntax goes to Ole Begemann, who started investigating `OSLogStore` early on and maintains an [OSLogStoreTest](https://github.com/ole/OSLogStoreTest) sample project. 

### iOS Entitlement Issues

While it’s fairly easy to work around the first two bugs, the third one is a real showstopper. While accessing the log store works great on macOS AppKit and macOS Catalyst, it fails with an entitlement error on iOS:

```
Error Domain=OSLogErrorDomain Code=9 "Client lacks entitlement to perform operation"
UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Client lacks entitlement to perform operation, _OSLogErrorInternalCode=14}
```

Why this wouldn’t work isn’t documented, and neither is what entitlement is required. There’s [anecdotal](https://twitter.com/bjtitus/status/1276211162506424323) [evidence](https://twitter.com/justkwin/status/1276271590360199172) on Twitter that Apple’s intent is to allow this on iOS, however, we’re slowly nearing the end of Apple’s beta cycle and there hasn’t been an official announcement or a fix.

If you feel strongly about this, please also report a radar and engage in the [discussion](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/658229) on Apple’s Developer Forum.

### Digging Deeper

How does `OSLogStore` access logs in the first place? The store is part of the OSLog framework, which includes a small XPC service. At initialization time, the store opens a synchronous XPC request to `com.apple.OSLogService`, the service included in the framework.

`OSLogService` ensures logs are filtered for the current process and then accesses `OSLogEventStore`. `OSLogEventStore` is implemented in the private `LoggingSupport.framework`. Here, you can see it connects to `logd` and also captures the failure condition, which ultimately produces the entitlement error.

If we keep digging and also take a look at `logd`, we find references to various private entitlements:

- `com.apple.private.logging.admin`
- `com.apple.private.logging.diagnostic`

The admin one is required for accessing the log store. If we attach to both our app and logd, we can modify the flow at runtime to trick it into believing the entitlement is there, and voila, logging works on iOS!

Full credit goes to [Khaos Tian](https://twitter.com/khaost), who took the time to figure out the details. Attaching LLDB to logd requires [SIP to be disabled](https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos), since logd is hardened and doesn’t include the `get-task-allow` debug entitlement.

## Streaming OSLog

It’s often desirable to stream log messages as they come in. This is a feature of many popular analytics and logging frameworks. Of course, OSLog also needs this feature.

LLDB is doing exactly that; it listens to OSLog messages and prints the streams as they’re created. Thankfully, LLDB is open source, so we can look at [`DarwinLogCollector.cpp`](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/lldb/blob/master/tools/debugserver/source/MacOSX/DarwinLog/DarwinLogCollector.cpp), which implements this feature.[^1] 

[^1]: A more convenient implementation is in [FLEX](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX/blob/master/Classes/GlobalStateExplorers/SystemLog/FLEXOSLogController.m).

The SPI we need is in [`ActivityStreamSPI.h`](https://github.com/apple/llvm-project/blob/apple/master/lldb/tools/debugserver/source/MacOSX/DarwinLog/ActivityStreamSPI.h), which is part of LLDB. (It contains various structs which cannot be redefined in Swift; this file needs to be plain C.) The main functions that are important to us are:

```c
// Get an activity stream for a process.
typedef os_activity_stream_t (*os_activity_stream_for_pid_t)(
    pid_t pid, os_activity_stream_flag_t flags,
    os_activity_stream_block_t stream_block);

// Start the activity stream.
typedef void (*os_activity_stream_resume_t)(os_activity_stream_t stream);

// Stop the activity stream.
typedef void (*os_activity_stream_cancel_t)(os_activity_stream_t stream);

// Get a formatted message out of an activity.
typedef char *(*os_log_copy_formatted_message_t)(os_log_message_t log_message);
```

Given these functions, we can write a Swift[^3] class that accesses the streaming log. You can see a reference implementation in [my gist of `OSLogStream.swift`](https://gist.github.com/steipete/459a065f905a41f8f577fb02ef34206e). While this works, SPI is still a private API and you shouldn’t ship this in the App Store ([FB8519418](https://openradar.appspot.com/FB8519418)).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/steipete/459a065f905a41f8f577fb02ef34206e.js"></script>

The [complete sample project is on GitHub](https://github.com/steipete/OSLogTest).

[^3]: There’s currently no way to correctly define C structs in Swift, so importing the `ActivityStreamSPI.h` C file is a requirement. This is a shame, as it makes releasing the sample code above as a SwiftPM module nearly impossible. We can either rewrite everything in Objective-C to make it work or hope that mixed-mode projects will be supported eventually.

## Conclusion

OSLog is an extremely awesome API and all the pieces are there — they’re just currently locked away behind private APIs, entitlements, and some bugs. It remains exciting to see if Apple will fix the various issues in `OSLogStore` before the GM. Or does it work as intended?

## Update: Testing with iOS 14 Beta 8

Apple changed the header documentation for `OSLogStore` to explain which certificate is needed (`com.apple.logging.local-store`):

```objc
 *
 * Gaining access to the local unified logging system requires
 * permission from the system. The caller must be run by an admin
 * account and the have the com.apple.logging.local-store
 * entitlement.
 */
+ (nullable instancetype)localStoreAndReturnError:(NSError **)error
API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.15)) API_UNAVAILABLE(ios, tvos, watchos)
NS_SWIFT_NAME(local());
```

However, running my example on iOS now fails completely because the `storeWithScope:error:` initializer is completely missing: 

```
+[OSLogStore storeWithScope:error:]: unrecognized selector sent to class 0x1fae85728
```

If we use the runtime to look at what’s there instead, we can verify that it’s gone. Interestingly enough, the “unavailable” `localStore` initializer exists on iOS:

```
(lldb) expression -l objc -O -- [[OSLogStore class] _methodDescription]
<OSLogStore: 0x1fae85728>:
in OSLogStore:
	Class Methods:
		+ (id) localStoreAndReturnError:(id*)arg1; (0x1ce73622c)
		+ (id) storeWithURL:(id)arg1 error:(id*)arg2; (0x1ce735f10)
	Instance Methods:
		- (id) entriesEnumeratorWithOptions:(unsigned long)arg1 position:(id)arg2 predicate:(id)arg3 error:(id*)arg4; (0x1ce735ce0)
		...
```

When we use some header trickery to call this initializer, we get the following error:

```
Domain=OSLogErrorDomain Code=10 "Connection to logd failed" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Connection to logd failed, _OSLogErrorInternalCode=15}
```

Simulator prints a slightly different error:

```
Error Domain=OSLogErrorDomain Code=-1 "No access to local store" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=No access to local store}
```

Using `OSLogStore(scope: .currentProcessIdentifier)` works on Simulator, but it still prints the familiar “Client lacks entitlement to perform operation” error. Declaring `com.apple.logging.local-store` in the entitlements didn’t change anything:

```
Error Domain=OSLogErrorDomain Code=9 "Client lacks entitlement to perform operation" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Client lacks entitlement to perform operation, _OSLogErrorInternalCode=14}
failure(Foundation._GenericObjCError.nilError)
```

The Swift shims for enumeration are still missing. Given that this is likely the last beta before the GM, it doesn’t look like `OSLogStore` will be functional.

Accessing the log store still works on Catalyst, however I only did a quick run, as [running Catalyst apps is broken](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1302972915193962497) in the current beta.

## Update: Tested with iOS 14 GM

Apple removed `OSLogStore` from iOS completely with the iOS 14 GM release.

```objc
API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.15)) API_UNAVAILABLE(ios, tvos, watchos)
OS_EXPORT
@interface OSLogStore : NSObject
```

This is a surprising move and really sad. If you think Apple is not understanding developer's requirements here and the removal of this API will make logging slower and less secure for everyone, please make yourself heard and [submit Feedback](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/).
