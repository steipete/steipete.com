Twitter has been the most important social network for my career, my source of news and helped me forge friendships. It can be tricky to navigate this social network. I developed a few strategies over the year to keep it fun

## Client

I've used Tweetbot for quite a while but eventually settled to using Twitter for iOS and Mac. Twitter started with the concept of an open API, but eventually added more and more features that haven't been added to the API, so while 3rd-party apps really try, they can't replicate the Twitter experience you get with the native client.

**Examples:**
- The Activity screen is not doable with the Twitter API, so you can't really see which tweets resonate and which don't.
- Twitter Polls are not visible in 3rd-party clients.
- Threads can be somewhat reconstructed via searches, but that's a slower process and fails if the client runs out of API quota or the thread is too large.
- Tweets where replying is limited are displayed as regular tweets and just return an error when you try to reply. This is frustrating. The official Twitter client does show if you can reply.
- Typing indicator via DMs. In fact, Twitter disabled their Streaming API so DMs are pretty much unusable unless you use the official client.
- Much more that isn't relevant but noteworthy: Bookmarks, Data Saver mode, 4k Images, ...

If you're looking for good 3rd-party clients, check [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) and [Aviary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1522043420).

## Your Online Persona

There's many strategies for online personas, I can only share what works really well for me. I follow people to cover specific areas/topics and also for their commentary/personality. In a way Twitter is a newsfeed where the comments become before the content, and you pick people for content.

I'm known for talking about iOS, sometimes company building and have a pretty sharp tongue on tech news. I used to keep politics out of my feed but after 2016 I do sprinkle in topics that are important to me, from US politics to climate change and LGBTQ rights. 

There will always be people that complain that XY topic shouldn't be on Twitter, but in the end that's your choice and it's their choice to follow you, not yours.

I'm openly gay on Twitter, but only in the last few years also started talking about that. Being open does allow me to put unique perspective on some content, and it does add more complexity to my persona. I don't share pictures or private content though, that part is for Instagram.

Whatever you go with, be authentic. I don't share everything on Twitter, but what I share is honest and usually done with passion, interesting or funny. I do not share content for money or for favors - only if I find it interesting.

### Your Avatar

Pick an Avatar that you like and stick with it. I do recommend a real face and not a sketch or something more abstract, as it'll help folks identify you at conferences or events. Make sure you use the same picture and use it everywhere (GitHub, Gravatar, Email, ...) so you have one universal online identity. People will scan the picture much faster than your name - changing it will result in a temporary loss of engagement and is usually something folks dislike. You can change it, but I recommend not doing that or at least only every few years.

Or, you can be [really sneaky and just re-make your picture so it slightly changes every year](https://krausefx.com/blog/continuous-delivery-for-your-profile-picture).

### Direct Messages

I highly recommend going into setting and enabling "Receive messages from anyone". There's a lot of great commentary from people I received via DM since they're not comfortable replying publicly. There's the occasional odd messages (and inappropriate offers) but if you're a cis white male you likely are good. Minority groups might want to reconsider this setting or at least enable the Quality Filter.

I suggest you experiment with that - this is easy to undo.

### Multiple Profiles

Quite a few of my friends have "alt" accounts for the hot takes or for talking with friends. If you work at a Big Corp, you might are required to filter what you say and having an alt can be a solution. In general I don't recommend making an alt-account, as it's simply too much work to maintain multiple accounts. Just tweet out your hot takes and attract the right followers on your main.

## Extending Reach

### Blog Posts

Twitter is a great indicator for topics that people find interesting - [I often get my best ideas for blog posts out of Twitter conversations](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1297956386836566016), and also already have half the content there. Twitter is great for inspiration and to learn, but it's hard to read conversations - go the extra mile and convert some of these interactions to blog posts. This will greatly extend your reach, and in turn attract new followers that find you content interesting.

### Conference Talks

Speaking at conferences is a great way to meet new people and extend your social circle. I often meet folks at conferences, and either we connect on Twitter or we find out that we already know each other! Either way - this will increase the bond and will make it more likely that people reach out to you. Conferences are work, but they are so worth it. 

Bonus: Convert your conference talk to a blog post - very few people will actually watch a recording, so via recycling and reshaping content you already have, you can extend your reach again.

If you plan on starting to speak, create a website where you talk about what topics you can talk about and your bio. I'm using [a simple GitHub repo](https://github.com/steipete/speaking) that has been proven extremely useful, both for me to track past events, to attract new speaking gigs and to help conference organizers with getting the information they need to announce me.

### Engage with your Audience

I try to reply to almost all folks that interact with me on Twitter. This doesn't take much time, and sometimes I just reply with an emoji, but it does show your audience that you care, and they're much more likely to interact with your content again, if they know that it's not a one-way street. Same goes to your feed - don't just read, reply. This can range from helping others with questions/problems, or just a "me too", a retweet - you name it. Sometimes I get content in my feed via a retweet and through me interacting I get a new follower.

### Tracking Statistics

Be consistent. You won't grow an audience over night. Make Twitter a daily thing. Share content. Be present - and you'll grow your audience every day.

I'm using [Birdbrain](http://birdbrainapp.com/) to track my Twitter numbers from time to time. It's been one of the oldest apps on my phone, so I have data since 2014. Interestingly my follower count has been growing pretty much linear:

[Twitter Analytics](https://analytics.twitter.com/) is also great to understand which tweets work.

## Tweets that Work

I do share a lot of news articles. I often just quote something interesting from the news if it's not something that needs a strong commentary, but something that does show that it's worth your time.

The tweets that are the most engaging however usually are original content. Here's a list of my top performing tweets of the last few months, with about 80k-450k impressions.

Lately I've been using more and more threads to connect tweets over time - this has been proven to be really great, as it immediately gives people context, they can read more and the official Twitter client also does show usually 2-3 tweets in a thread, giving you more "space" in the timeline. An example is this:

{% twitter https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1277623561604214784 %}

Sometimes it's the stupid tweets that explode:

{% twitter https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1310331623729229827 %}

Sometimes you don't need words:

{% twitter https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1306884214252613632?s=20 %}

Sometimes it is news commentary, if the comment is controversial enough.

{% twitter https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1288151223028322304 %}

Sometimes you can use context to be really pointy:

## Addendum: Building Personal Brands for Introverts

I've given a talk at UIKonf in Berlin in 2018 about Building Personal Brands for Introverts, which is still highly relevant and goes even deeper into this topic:
