Twitter has been the most important social network for my career, my source of news and helped me forge friendships. It can be tricky to navigate this social network. I developed a few strategies over the year to keep it fun

## Client

I've been using Tweetbot for quite a while but eventually settled to using Twitter for iOS and Mac. Twitter started with the concept of an open API, but eventually added more and more features that haven't been added to the API, so while 3rd-party apps really try, they can't replicate the Twitter experience you get with the native client.

**Examples:**
- The Activity screen is not doable with the Twitter API, so you can't really see which tweets resonate and which don't.
- Twitter Polls are not visible in 3rd-party clients.
- Threads can be somewhat reconstructed via searches, but that's a slower process and fails if the client runs out of API quota or the thread is too large.
- Tweets where replying is limited are displayed as regular tweets and just return an error when you try to reply. This is frustrating. The official Twitter client does show if you can reply.
- Typing indicator via DMs. In fact, Twitter disabled their Streaming API so DMs are pretty much unusable unless you use the official client.
- Much more that isn't relevant but noteworthy: Bookmarks, Data Saver mode, 4k Images, ...

If you're looking for good 3rd-party clients, check [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) and [Aviary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1522043420).

## Your Online Persona

There's many strategies for online personas, I can only share what works really well for me. I follow people to cover specific areas/topics and also for their commentary/personality. In a way Twitter is a newsfeed where the comments become before the content, and you pick people for content.

I'm known for talking about iOS, sometimes company building and have a pretty sharp tongue on tech news. I used to keep politics out of my feed but after 2016 I do sprinkle in topics that are important to me, from US politics to climate change and LGBTQ rights. 

There will always be people that complain that XY topic shouldn't be on Twitter, but in the end that's your choice and it's their choice to follow you, not yours.

I'm openly gay on Twitter, but only in the last few years also started talking about that. Being open does allow me to put unique perspective on some content, and it does add more complexity to my persona. I don't share pictures or private content though, that part is for Instagram.

Whatever you go with, be authentic. I don't share everything on Twitter, but what I share is honest and usually done with passion, interesting or funny. I do not share content for money or for favors - only if I find it interesting.

## Tweets that Work

There's roughly a few different categories of Tweets:

- Share News + Commentary. I often just quote something interesting from the news if it's not something that needs a strong commentary, but something that does show that it's worth your time.
- Questions
- Comments about your field of work
- Conversations

Example of a Tweet that really worked well:

## Managing the Timeline

Be picky who you follow. My goal is to stay below 1500 people. I try to read most in my timeline but gave up being a completionist. Twitter needs time and commitment but shouldn't feel like work, and there's time it definitely is work to read though everything.

I know that some people can take it personal if you unfollow, but I've been past caring about that. You need to filter what you consume, so unfollow when you don't enjoy someone's content.

Don't worry about missing out - Twitter is a stream and you can never read everything.

### Muting

Muting accounts is beautiful - people can still see your content, but you just don't see their replies anymore. In the early days it took a lot to make me mute someone, now I do it ruthlessly, including for accounts that I just don't find interesting but are RTed into my timeline (e.g. sports).

### Blocking

I very very rarely block. There's been a case where someone replies to a RT of mine with mean comments, and since that does show me as connection to hateful or insulting comments, I quickly blocked that person. If it's just a challenging reply, I  usually don't block - it's fun to be challenged! (And there's always mute)

## Disabling RTs

Some people retweet a lot of content that I don't find particularly interesting, so I disable retweets on their account. I do this probably for 5-10% of the accounts I follow and I know some people who have that on for 100%.

This also implies changes in Twitter behavior: If you want to be sure someone sees content, use a quote tweet. But don't use that too often, as [it can be annoying it itself](https://twitter.com/NeoNacho/status/1313595333159469056).

## Hashtags

Please don't use hashtags. If I could write a filter that automatically blocks all tweets with more than one hashtag, I would use it. It's usually people that don't know how Twitter work or ads that #use a #hashtag for #almost #every #word, and it's really unnecessary and annoying to read. Don't be a noob, don't use hashtags. Exception are for fun hashtags or conferences. #butwhatdoiknow

## Filter

### Direct Messages

I highly recommend going into setting and enabling "Receive messages from anyone". There's a lot of great commentary from people I received via DM since they're not comfortable replying publicly. There's the occasional odd messages (and inappropriate offers) but if you're a cis white male you likely are good. Minority groups might want to reconsider this setting or at least enable the Quality Filter.

I suggest you experiment with that - this is easy to undo.

### Muting Keywords

You can mute 100 keywords. It doesn't need to be a hashtag. Here's a selection of the things I mute:

- #MyTwitterAnniversary (I really don't care about these)
- shooting (Protects my sanity)
- constitution, police, assault, shooting, killing, #VOTE (Probably something American that will just make me upset)
- #digital, #offer, #BusinessTransformation, #sponsored, #blockchain, #bigdata (If you use this as keyword, the content will be crap)
- NASCAR, Lakers, #F1, Strava, #CloseYourRings (not interested in sports or where you run or bike)
- #Covid_19 (I read news about the pandemic when I feel like it. I don't need that every 5 minutes)
- [food] (I already like food too much)

### Muting Accounts

Unlike keywords, there's no limit in muting accounts. I pretty much mute all brands, accounts that serve ads and accounts that talk about topics I'm not interested in. Remember, you are in control of what you consume, so be selective and remove the noise.

## Multiple Profiles

Quite a few of my friends have "alt" accounts for the hot takes or for talking with friends. If you work at a Big Corp, you might are required to filter what you say and having an alt can be a solution. In general I don't recommend making an alt-account, as it's simply too much work to maintain multiple accounts. Just tweet out your hot takes and attract the right followers on your main.

## Building Personal Brands for Introverts

I've given a talk at UIKonf in Berlin in 2018 about Building Personal Brands for Introverts, which is still highly relevant and goes even deeper into this topic:
