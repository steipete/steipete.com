Apple released SwiftUI last year, and it's been a really exciting and wild ride. With iOS 14, a lot of the rough edges have been fixed â€” is SwiftUI getting ready for production?

## Fruta

Let's look at Apple's Fruta example, a cross-platform feature-rich app that's completely built in SwiftUI. It's great that Apple finally releases a more complex application for this year's cycle. I took a look when Big Sur beta 1 came out, and it's been pretty rough:

Since then there's been many betas and we're nearing the end of the cycle, with the GM expected in October. It's time to look at it again. And indeed the SwiftUI team did a great job at fixing the various issues - toolbar works pretty reliable, the sidebar no longer jumps out, multiple windows works, however it's still fairly easy to make it crash:

While the crash seems to happen faster on macOS, it's also [pretty easy to crash it on iOS 14b8](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305052083989684224?s=21). There's also [various view bugs](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305054121523916806?s=21) when someone navigates "too fast".

### SwiftUI AttributeGraph Errors

Whenever you see `AG::Graph` in the stack trace that's Swift's AttributeGraph, which takes over representing the view hierarchy and diffing. Bugs there usually are in this form:

```
 Fruta[3607:1466511] [error] precondition failure: invalid size for indirect attribute: 25 vs 24
```

Googling for this error reveals that there's [a](https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager/issues/60) [lot](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/129171) [of](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304009/how-to-debug-precondition-failure-in-xcode) [similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/comments/fosrbf/precondition_failure_invalid_input_index/) [problems](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1258762457805455361), people sometimes do find workaround via wrapping views into other views or changing the hierarchy. Mostly though you are powerless, this is something Apple needs to fix in their framework.

## Other Crashes

## Performance

On my 2,4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 MacBook Pro, changing the selection takes over a second to update the main view. This feels sluggish and it significantly longer than even most websites - that load data via the network - need. Fruta has everything local. What's so slow here?

* Of the 10 seconds captured, 30% are used for Swift and ObjC's various retain/release and malloc's.
* `NSAttributedString` shows up often in stack traces, giving us a hint that text layout seems especially expensive.
* The AttributeGraph SwiftUI layout engine seems to create a lot of throwaway objects. These might mostly be Swift structs, however they still are expensive.
* JPG decoding happens on the main thread, however is only responsible of less than 1% of the time spent here.
* When checking "Hide System Libraries" there's basically no work done in Fruta's business logic. 
* Sorting for "Top Functions" we see that AppKit's auto layout logic is taking up a lot of time, combined with SwiftUI's graph.
* There seems to be a lot of unnecessary invalidation. For example, the `AppKitToolbarCoordinator` adds a toolbar item, which triggers `NSHostingView.preferencesDidChange()` causing everything to re-layout once again, even though the toolbar size doesn't change.

The good news is, there seem to be a lot of potential future optimizations possible to make this fast. Alternative, there's always the possibility to [drop out of SwiftUI for performance critical parts](https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1304938866999046144?s=21). He [stopped development](https://twitter.com/Dimillian/status/1301802048824979456) because it's so slow that it's not shippable.

This is not unique to Fruta, I've been taking a look at [@Dimillian's](https://twitter.com/Dimillian) RedditOS app which is built with SwiftUI on macOS. I did some debugging with an earlier version of Big Sur where the app still somewhat worked:

{% twitter https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1282655123244752897?s=20 %}

The general pattern here is AppKit.

{% twitter https://twitter.com/stuartcarnie/status/1301895206875181056 %}

It's important to understand that SwiftUI in itself is fast - for many use cases it's faster than even using `CALayer`.

## Conclusion

If your target platform is iOS 14, you're now good to go with hobby projects. I personally wouldn't yet use it for production apps, although the crash rate likely is manageable and Apple is actively improving things with every release. Remember that SwiftUI ships with the OS, not with your app, so any bug fixes will only help if your users update the OS.

Other ports are not so great. AppKit seems particularly trouble, but I also heard of big issues with tvOS. If you need to deploy your app to the Mac, use Catalyst, which is a much more stable binding and feels really good with Big Sur's native mode where content is no longer scaled.

If you are curious about SwiftUI, please don't let this stop your enthusiasm. It's clearly the future at Apple and all these issues will be resolved within a few years.
