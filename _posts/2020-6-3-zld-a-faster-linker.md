zld is [a drop-in replacement of Apple's linker](https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld) that uses optimized data structures and parallelizing to speed things up. It comes with a great promise:

In our setup, this indeed improves overall build time by ~25%, measured from a clean build to the running application. Building [PSPDFCatalog](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/getting-started/example-projects/) in debug mode with [ccache](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2015/ccache-for-fun-and-profit/) enabled and everything pre-cached takes roughly:

- ld: 4:40min
- zld: 3:30min

## Installation
Zld is easy to enable for your project:

1. `brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld`
2. `OTHER_LDFLAGS = -fuse-ld=/usr/local/bin/zld`

In our setup, things aren't quite so easy, we have a few additional requirements.

- Build should work independently of `zld` installed, so people can opt in at their own time and don't have a surprising build failure after pulling master. This is even more true for CI.
- We have a large [monorepo](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/benefits-of-a-monorepo/) with different projects in different folders, managed by shared `xcconfig` files.

I wrote a `zld-detect` wrapper that conditionally forwards to `zld` if found, else uses Apple's default linker:

```
#!/bin/sh

# /usr/local/bin is not always included in the Xcode context
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

# Detect if zld is available
if type -p zld >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  exec zld "$@"
else
  exec ld "$@"
fi
```

The second problem (different paths) was solved by defining a `REPOROOT = "$(SRCROOT)/../..";` in each project, so we can build a path from the root of the monorepo and only have one location for the `zld-detect` script:

```
OTHER_LDFLAGS = -ObjC -Wl,-no_uuid -fuse-ld=$(REPOROOT)/iOS/Resources/zld-detect
```

## Mac Catalyst

After implementing the above, our Mac Catalyst builds started failing:

```
Building for Mac Catalyst, but linking in .tbd built for , file '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks//CoreImage.framework/CoreImage.tbd' for architecture x86_64
```

It seems there's some special code in the linker that helps with linking the correct framework for Mac Catalyst, which isn't yet part of the v510 release. Apple released [v520 and v530 of the ld64 project](https://opensource.apple.com/source/ld64/) so there's a good chance this is fixed once `zld` merges with upstream ([Tracked in #43](https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld/issues/43)).

Writing this conditionally in `xcconfig` is tricky, as there's no support for a separate architecture like `[sdk=maccatalyst]` (Apple folks: FB6822740)

Here's how things look if we put everything together:

```
// Settings to improve link time performance for debug/test builds
// https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld#a-faster-version-of-apples-linker
// Linker fails for Mac Catalyst - maybe try once it's updated to v530.
// This is always defined as YES or NO
PSPDF_ZLD = -fuse-ld=$(REPOROOT)/iOS/Resources/zld-detect
PSPDF_LINKER_MACCATALYST_YES = ""
PSPDF_LINKER_MACCATALYST_NO = $(PSPDF_ZLD)
// This will be the case on iOS
PSPDF_LINKER_MACCATALYST_ = $(PSPDF_ZLD)
PSPDF_LINKER_IF_NOT_CATALYST = $(PSPDF_LINKER_MACCATALYST_$(IS_MACCATALYST))
PSPDF_NORELEASE_LDFLAGS = -ObjC -Wl,-no_uuid $(PSPDF_LINKER_IF_NOT_CATALYST)
```

In `Defaults-Debug.xcconfig` and `Defaults-testing.xcconfig`
```
// Use fast linker if available
OTHER_LDFLAGS = $(inherited) $(PSPDF_NORELEASE_LDFLAGS)
```

That's it! [Let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/steipete) if this was helpful.
